no-code AI agents: Scalability without traditional coding

AI Agents with No-Code Tools Using n8n
AI agent workflows built using n8n, demonstrating how no-code automation can power intelligent systems for autonomous action and document-based retrieval.

Project Overview:

1. Autonomous AI Agent with Workflow Logic
An AI-driven agent capable of planning, reasoning, and acting across multi-step tasks—all within a visual, no-code environment. Using n8n’s logic nodes, triggering mechanisms, and prompt chaining, this workflow simulates autonomous behavior with minimal manual input.

Highlights:
- Triggered via webhooks and scheduled events
- Integrated with LLMs to perform logical task flows
- Implemented tool chaining and conditional logic for decision-making
- Added robust error handling and path control mechanisms

Tech Stack:
n8n • LLM Integration • Prompt Chaining • Trigger-Based Automation • Workflow Logic • Error Handling

2. RAG Agent for Document Intelligence
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent that automates the ingestion, embedding, and retrieval of content from Google Drive. Embeddings are generated using OpenAI or Google Gemini models and stored in Supabase, enabling high-performance semantic search workflows.

Highlights:
- Automated document ingestion from Google Drive
- Generated and stored embeddings in Supabase for vector search
- Queried vector store to fetch contextually relevant information
- Designed for fast, real-time responses with optimized latency

Tech Stack:
- n8n • Google Drive API • Supabase • OpenAI / Google Gemini Embeddings • RAG Architecture • No-Code Automation

Why It Matters:
These no-code AI agents showcase how visual automation platforms like n8n can transcend simple task automation to create adaptive, intelligent workflows. From autonomous decision-making to content-aware querying, these projects highlight:
- Scalability without traditional coding
- Seamless integration with AI APIs and databases
- Real-life readiness for deployment in productivity and knowledge-driven systems
